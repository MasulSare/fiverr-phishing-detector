## Fiverr Integration Guide

### Messaging System Integration

1. Direct API Integration:
   ```python
   from fiverr_messaging import Message
   from phishing_detector import PhishingDetector

   def process_message(message: Message):
       detector = PhishingDetector()
       results = detector.analyze_message(
           message.content,
           message.headers
       )
       return handle_results(results)
   ```

2. Message Queue Integration:
   ```python
   import json
   from message_queue import MessageQueue
   from phishing_detector import PhishingDetector

   queue = MessageQueue('fiverr_messages')
   detector = PhishingDetector()

   def process_queue():
       for message in queue.receive():
           results = detector.analyze_message(
               message['content'],
               message['headers']
           )
           if results['risk_level'] == 'High':
               message.block()
           elif results['risk_level'] == 'Medium':
               message.flag_for_review()
   ```

### Common Fiverr Phishing Scenarios

1. External Payment Scam:
   ```python
   message = """
   Hi! I can offer you a better deal if you pay through PayPal directly.
   Contact me: example@payment.com
   """
   results = detector.analyze_message(message)
   # Will detect: external payment, contact outside platform
   ```

2. Fake Order Completion:
   ```python
   message = """
   URGENT: Your order #12345 is completed. Click here to receive payment:
   http://fiverr-payments.tk/claim
   """
   results = detector.analyze_message(message)
   # Will detect: suspicious URL, urgent action, payment scam
   ```

3. Support Team Impersonation:
   ```python
   message = """
   Fiverr Support Team: Your account needs verification.
   Contact: whatsapp +1234567890
   """
   results = detector.analyze_message(message)
   # Will detect: support impersonation, external contact
   ```

## Deployment Guide

### Production Deployment

1. Set up environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv /opt/fiverr/phishing_detector
   source /opt/fiverr/phishing_detector/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   ```

### High-Availability Setup

   - Configure auto-scaling

2. Redis Cache Integration:
   ```python
   from redis import Redis
   redis_client = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
   
   def cache_detection_results(message_id, results):
       redis_client.setex(f"phishing:{message_id}", 3600, json.dumps(results))
   ```

3. Monitoring Setup:
   - Configure Prometheus metrics
   - Set up Grafana dashboards
   - Enable error alerting

### Performance Optimization

1. Batch Processing:
   ```python
   def process_batch(messages: List[Dict]):
       with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
           results = executor.map(detector.analyze_message, messages)
   ```

2. Caching Strategies:
   - Cache frequent patterns
   - Store known malicious URLs
   - Cache analysis results
